### 🎯 Who I Work Best With

Let's talk if you're a founder who is:

1.  **At the MVP stage** with a validated idea and need a **rapid, technical co-founder** to take it to market in 4-6 weeks.
2.  **Growth-stage** and need to integrate **AI features** or optimize performance for a scaling user base.
3.  **Targeting the Algerian/MENA market** and need a specialist who can handle the complexity of local payment and logistics integrations.

**I don't just write code—I build products that generate revenue.**
